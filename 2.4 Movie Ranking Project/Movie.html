	<h1> The Best Movies According to Jozh </h1>
	<h2>My Top 3 Greatest of All Time Movies </h2>
	<hr />
	<h3>Dope</h3>
	<p>A great film about 90s nostaliga, living in california and coming of age in a rough neighborhood</p>
	<h3>Children of Men</h3>
	<p>a dark and cinematic masterpiece delivered with exciting and heart breaking single take shots and dynamic perfromances by the actors. In dystopian future where women lose the ability to bear children, what will men do to protect the only new mother to come about in the last 20 years? </p>
	<h3> Dune Part 2 </h3>
	<p>A return to cinema! A movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen and has expertly supplanted my expectations of film to book adaptations as well as set a new standard for the Scifi Genre. I left the theatre thinking your either one of 2 kinds of scifi lovers either your a Dune person or an Avatar person and I'm undoubtley a Dune person</p>
